Ruby on Rails is a powerful framework for app development but it lacks the “fast math” and libraries needed for Machine Learning. There are great efforts trying to fill the second gap, for instance <a href="http://sciruby.com/" target="_blank">SciRuby</a>  and <a href="http://www.ai4r.org/" target="_blank" >AI4R</a>,  but there are much better languages alternatives for those kind of calculations.

Among those languages there is ‘R’, which is focused on statistical computing and is widely used by data miners thanks to it’s performance and tools available. This tutorial will guide you to benefit from those two worlds by connecting your Rails app with R, through a Rails RESTful API and a R module for apache.
